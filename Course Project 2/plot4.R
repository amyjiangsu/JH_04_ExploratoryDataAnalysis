# Q4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related 
# sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Loading provided datasets - loading from local folder
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Finding SCC code for coal combusion-related emission
coal.emission.code <- grep("coal", SCC$Short.Name, ignore.case = T)
coal.emission.code  <- SCC[coal.emission.code,]

# Subsetting NEI data using coal.emission.code
coal.emission.data <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% coal.emission.code$SCC, ]

# Getting total coal emission by year
coal.emission.by.year <- tapply(coal.emission.data$Emissions, coal.emission.data$year, sum)
